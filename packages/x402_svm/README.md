# x402_svm

SVM (Solana) blockchain implementation for the x402 payment protocol. This package provides signers and schemes specifically for Solana and other SVM-compatible chains.

**Note:** Most users should use the [x402](https://pub.dev/packages/x402) package directly, as it exports the SVM functionality and provides a more convenient multi-chain experience.

## Features

- `SvmSigner`: Signature handling using Solana keypairs.
- Support for SPL Token transfers.
- Automated Solana transaction building and signing for x402 payloads.
