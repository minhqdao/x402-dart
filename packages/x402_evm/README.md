# x402_evm

EVM-compatible blockchain implementation for the x402 payment protocol. This package provides signers and schemes specifically for Ethereum and other EVM chains.

**Note:** Most users should use the [x402](https://pub.dev/packages/x402) package directly, as it exports the EVM functionality and provides a more convenient multi-chain experience.

## Features

- `EvmSigner`: Signature handling using Ethereum private keys.
- EIP-3009 (USDC) authorization support.
- EIP-712 typed data signing.
